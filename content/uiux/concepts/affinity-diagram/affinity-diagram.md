**Affinity diagram** is a visual method used in UX to organize large sets of qualitative data into meaningful groups. It helps designers synthesize research findings, uncover themes, and prioritize user needs by clustering related insights.

This method is especially useful during the synthesis phase of research when ideas, quotes, or observations need to be interpreted collaboratively.

## When to Create an Affinity Diagram

Affinity diagrams are typically created after collecting qualitative data such as:

- Interview quotes or observations
- Survey responses
- Notes from usability tests
- Brainstorming ideas from team sessions

They are commonly used during:

- Research synthesis
- Problem framing
- Ideation and early concept planning
- Stakeholder alignment workshops

## How to Build an Affinity Diagram

1. _Gather raw data or observations_  
   Pull relevant user quotes, ideas, pain points, or behavioral notes onto individual cards or sticky notes. Each card should contain one point or idea.

2. _Sort items into related groups_  
   Without labels, begin clustering related notes based on similarity. This should be done collaboratively to uncover patterns through discussion.

3. _Label the clusters_  
   Once groups emerge, give each one a meaningful heading that captures the underlying theme or insight, such as "Trust issues" or "Onboarding friction."

4. _Prioritize insights if needed_  
   Some clusters may represent more critical issues than others. Use dot-voting or effort-impact axes to highlight which themes require action.

## Benefits of Using Affinity Diagrams

- _Promotes shared understanding_  
  Team members synthesize data together, helping align on core themes and reduce bias.

- _Visualizes complexity_  
  Turning unstructured data into structured clusters helps reveal patterns and gaps that are difficult to identify in raw notes.

- _Encourages collaboration_  
  Effective in workshops or design studios where cross-functional teams make sense of findings together.

- _Enables informed decisions_  
  Synthesized insights can inform product roadmaps, feature prioritization, and persona development.
