**Accessibility** refers to designing devices, products, and environments such that individuals with disabilities or sensory impairments can successfully use them.

## Accessibility Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) break down accessibility into [four main principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/):

- **Perceivable**: Create content that can be perceived in different ways, for example, providing text alternatives for non-text content and content that can be perceived by assistive technologies like screen readers.
- **Operable**: Enable simple operation by making all functionality available from the keyboard, helping users navigate and find content, and giving users plenty of time to consume content.
- **Understandable**: Make text readable and understandable, make content appear in predictable ways, and help users avoid and correct mistakes.
- **Robust**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.

[Inclusive design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-methodologies/inclusive-design) focuses on designing for users of all demographics and abilities, while accessibility is specifically focused on designing for people with disabilities. Any product that doesn't consider accessibility and equity may (whether intentionally or not) exclude a portion of the population who would otherwise find it useful.

## What Accessibility Looks Like in Practice

Accessible UX design requires intentionality at every stage, from wireframing to testing:

- _Use semantic HTML structure and headings_  
  Proper use of elements like `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and heading levels improves navigation for screen readers.

- _Ensure color contrast meets minimum thresholds_  
  Text and interactive elements must be readable in low-light conditions and by users with visual impairments.

- _Label form fields and inputs clearly_  
  Labels, placeholders, and instructions should be provided with screen-reader-accessible markup.

- _Avoid using color alone to convey meaning_  
  Use text, icons, or shapes in addition to color cues to support color-blind users.

- _Design keyboard-accessible navigation_  
  Users should be able to navigate and interact with all elements using just a keyboard.

- _Write meaningful link text_  
  Avoid vague labels like “click here”. Instead describe the purpose of each link clearly.

> _Note: Accessibility is not just a legal or ethical requirement. It improves usability for all users, including those using small screens, older devices, or assistive technologies._

## Challenges Designers Should Consider

- _Animations and motion_  
  Ensure that animations respect the user's motion preference settings and avoid triggering vestibular disorders.

- _Alt text and media description_  
  Every image, chart, or embedded media must include an appropriate description for non-visual consumption.

- _Language and cognitive load_  
  Avoid jargon, acronyms, or long blocks of text that can overwhelm users with cognitive disabilities or non-native fluency.

- _Touch targets_  
  Buttons and links must be large enough and spaced adequately for users with limited motor control.

- _Testing tools may not catch everything_  
  Automated tools like axe or Lighthouse can help, but manual testing with screen readers or diverse users is still essential.
