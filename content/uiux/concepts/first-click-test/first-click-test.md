**First Click Testing** is a usability method used to evaluate the effectiveness of an interface's information hierarchy and design clarity. The test measures _where users click first_ when asked to complete a task — and whether that first click puts them on the correct path.

It is based on a simple but powerful insight:

> If a user's first click is correct, they are more likely to complete the task successfully.

Analyzing these initial interactions allows teams to spot usability issues early and validate navigation patterns, content labels, or layout choices.

## What It Measures

First Click Testing is focused on _user decision-making at the very start of a task_. It helps identify whether users understand what to do next, and whether your interface intuitively supports their goals.

Key metrics include:

- _Click accuracy_ – Did users click the correct item or path first?
- _Time to first click_ – How long did it take them to decide?
- _User confidence_ – How confident were they in their choice?
- _Completion rate_ – Did they finish the task successfully after the first click?
