**First Click Testing** is a usability method used to evaluate the effectiveness of an interface's information hierarchy and design clarity. The test measures **where users click first** when asked to complete a task — and whether that first click puts them on the correct path.

It is based on a simple but powerful insight:

> If a user's first click is correct, they are more likely to complete the task successfully.

Analyzing these initial interactions allows teams to spot usability issues early and validate navigation patterns, content labels, or layout choices.

## What It Measures

First Click Testing is focused on **user decision-making at the very start of a task**. It helps identify whether users understand what to do next, and whether your interface intuitively supports their goals.

Key metrics include:

- **Click accuracy** – Did users click the correct item or path first?
- **Time to first click** – How long did it take them to decide?
- **User confidence** – How confident were they in their choice?
- **Completion rate** – Did they finish the task successfully after the first click?
