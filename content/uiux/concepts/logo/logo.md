A **logo** is a symbol, graphic, or emblem, that is used to represent a company, product, or brand. A logo presents a unique opportunity for companies to stand out and create a brand identity that assists in brand recognition. Additionally, the color of a logo plays a significant role in how a brand is perceived based on the emotional response it creates.

Companies such as [Google](https://www.google.com), [Nike](https://www.nike.com), [Apple](https://www.apple.com), [McDonald’s](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html), and, last but not least, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), have logos that are recognized around the world.

## Variations and Formats

Digital products require flexible logo systems that adapt across contexts. Common formats include:

- _Primary logo._  
  The full version including both symbol and wordmark.

- _Logomark only._  
  A standalone icon or symbol without text.

- _Responsive logo._  
  A simplified version used in small spaces like navbars or tab icons.

- _Monochrome or inverted logo._  
  Versions designed for dark mode, grayscale, or print compatibility.

> _Note: A logo must remain legible and balanced across formats, screen sizes, and accessibility contexts._

## What a Logo Communicates

A logo can convey subtle but powerful messages about the brand:

- _Tone of voice._  
  A logo sets expectations — playful, professional, experimental, minimalist.

- _Industry or domain cues._  
  Symbols, colors, and typefaces suggest alignment with sectors like education, health, or finance.

- _Company values._  
  Visual traits signal identity — bold vs. quiet, modern vs. traditional, innovative vs. stable.
