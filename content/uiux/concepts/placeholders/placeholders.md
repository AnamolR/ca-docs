When creating [sketches](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/sketching) or [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe), [low-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/low-fidelity) **placeholders** are used to represent [high-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/high-fidelity) content such as text, images, and videos. [Wireframe elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe-elements) are an example of placeholder content. Indicating the use and placement of an element, without emphasis on how the content will appear visually, is what placeholders achieve.

## Purpose in Design

Placeholders help designers and stakeholders focus on layout and interaction flow without getting distracted by details such as final copy or image styling.

They are often used in:

- _Low-fidelity wireframes_ to represent headings, paragraphs, and buttons using grey boxes or "lorem ipsum" text.
- _Content planning_ sessions to mark where dynamic or pending assets (such as videos or embedded charts) will go.
- _Prototyping_ when functionality needs to be tested before assets are finalized.

## Types of Placeholders

Common forms of placeholders include:

- _Text placeholders_  
  Generic copy such as “Headline here” or “Lorem ipsum” to represent future body content.

- _Image placeholders_  
  Grey boxes or icons marked with an 'X', a camera symbol, or image dimensions (e.g., 800×600).

- _UI component placeholders_  
  Blocks or lines indicating future dropdowns, tabs, or carousels in a layout.

- _Loading placeholders (skeleton screens)_  
  Shimmering or animated blocks displayed while real data is being fetched — often used in modern web applications.

> _Note:_ Skeleton screens are a special category of placeholders focused on perceived performance rather than structural design.
