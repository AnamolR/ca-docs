**Research methods** in UX are structured techniques used to gather qualitative and quantitative data about user behavior, needs, and pain points. These methods help designers make evidence-based decisions, reduce assumptions, and ensure the final product aligns with real-world user expectations.

Different research methods are used depending on the stage of the design process, the type of product, and the resources available.

## When to Use Different Research Methods

There is no single "best" research method â€” each serves a specific purpose. Choosing the right method depends on your goals, timeline, and what you're trying to learn.

- _At the beginning of a project_  
  Use discovery methods to learn about user goals, mental models, and context.

- _During ideation and design_  
  Test early concepts to ensure they resonate with real users before development begins.

- _Post-launch or during iteration_  
  Evaluate how well a design performs and identify new opportunities for improvement.

## Common UX Research Methods

The following list covers popular qualitative and quantitative UX research methods and when to apply them.

### Qualitative Methods

These help understand the _why_ behind user behavior and generate rich, descriptive insights:

- _[User interviews](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/interviews)_  
  One-on-one conversations that explore motivations, frustrations, and context of use.

- _Field Studies_  
  Observation of users in their natural environment to uncover unspoken behaviors and habits.

- _[Diary Studies](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/diary-study)_
  Participants self-report experiences over time, useful for tracking workflows and recurring pain points.

- _[Card Sorting](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/card-sorting)_  
  Helps reveal how users categorize information and label content in navigation systems.

- _Think-aloud Protocol_  
  Encourages users to verbalize their thoughts while performing tasks, providing insight into mental models.

- _Unmodetated Usability Testing_
  A researcher observes users completing tasks and asks clarifying questions during or after the session.

### Quantitative Methods

These involve measurable data and help validate assumptions with statistical significance:

- _Surveys and Questionnaires_  
  Gather responses from large groups to identify trends or perceptions across users.

- _A/B Testing_  
  Compares two versions of a design to determine which performs better based on predefined metrics.

- _Analytics Review_  
  Uses behavioral data like clicks, drop-off rates, or conversion to understand usage patterns.

- _Unmoderated Usability Testing_  
  Participants complete tasks independently, with results collected via screen recordings or heatmaps.

> _Note: Combining [qualitative](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/qualitative-research) and [quantitative](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/quantitative-research) methods can provide both depth and scale to your research findings._
