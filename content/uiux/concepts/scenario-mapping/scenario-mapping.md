**Scenario Mapping** is a collaborative UX method used to visualize how users interact with a product in different real-world contexts. It helps teams align around user goals, pain points, and workflows by mapping scenarios (or situations) to specific features and solutions.

Scenario mapping combines insights from user research, personas, and jobs-to-be-done frameworks to create a shared understanding of how people use products in varying situations — and what support they need to succeed.

## What Is a Scenario?

In UX, a _scenario_ describes a short, narrative-based situation where a user tries to accomplish a specific task under certain conditions. These stories are fictional but rooted in real research and help reveal the context in which users interact with a product.

Example scenario:

> Lisa is trying to check out quickly on her phone during her lunch break, but she cannot remember her password and does not have time to reset it.

## Why Use Scenario Mapping

Scenario mapping helps teams understand user behavior in a structured, task-oriented way. It surfaces design opportunities and usability gaps before wireframes or prototypes are even created.

### Key benefits

- _Keeps design grounded in real-world behavior_
  Mapping scenarios forces teams to think about why, when, and how users will engage with features — not just what the features are.

- _Supports cross-functional alignment_
  Designers, researchers, developers, and stakeholders can collaborate to explore pain points, edge cases, and user needs.

- _Improves feature prioritization_
  Examining which scenarios occur most often or have the highest risk of failure, allows teams to focus on the most impactful solutions.

- _Encourages empathy and user-centric thinking_
  Thinking through scenarios encourages teams to consider the user's mindset, emotions, and goals, not just interface mechanics.

## When to Use Scenario Mapping

Scenario mapping is most useful during:

- _Early ideation or discovery phases_
  To explore how people might use your product in different contexts.

- _Design sprints and workshops_
  To gather cross-disciplinary insights in real time.

- _Feature planning_
  To understand what workflows need to be supported or simplified.

- _Post-research synthesis_
  To connect interview data with actionable design opportunities.
