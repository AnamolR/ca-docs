In UI and UX Design, a **stakeholder** is anyone who impacts or is impacted by a certain project. This could include your intended users, administrators and IT professionals helping set up your product, the engineers and product managers on your team, the salespeople who will be selling your product, and many more.

## Types of Stakeholders in UX Projects

Stakeholders may differ based on the organization or product, but common types include:

- _Internal team members._  
  Designers, developers, product managers, researchers, and QA engineers.

- _Business leaders and executives._  
  Decision-makers who define priorities, strategy, and resource allocation.

- _Marketing and sales teams._  
  Teams responsible for product positioning and promotion.

- _Customer support or success teams._  
  Individuals who gather insights from user feedback and recurring issues.

- _End users or user representatives._  
  The people who use the product or act on their behalf (e.g., user advocates).

- _Legal, compliance, or security roles._  
  Stakeholders who set constraints based on policies or regulations.

> _Note: Not all stakeholders speak the same language as designers. Translating UX insights into their priorities is a valuable design skill._

## Stakeholder Influence on UX

Stakeholders influence UX throughout the design lifecycle:

- _Defining feature scope and priorities._  
  Product managers and business owners determine what gets designed and when.

- _Shaping success metrics._  
  Executives and analysts establish KPIs that guide product strategy.

- _Aligning content and branding._  
  Marketing teams ensure consistency with tone and visual identity.

- _Introducing constraints and compliance._  
  Legal teams set rules that affect content, interaction patterns, or functionality.

## Collaborating with Stakeholders

Effective UX work includes clear communication and collaboration across functions:

- _Set expectations early._  
  Define processes, deliverables, and roles at the outset.

- _Involve stakeholders in research._  
  Invite them to observe sessions or contribute questions.

- _Translate UX insights into business value._  
  Frame findings in terms of cost savings, retention, or satisfaction.

- _Use accessible, jargon-free communication._  
  Tailor presentations to meet varying levels of domain knowledge.

- _Be open to negotiation._  
  Balance user needs with technical feasibility and business goals.
