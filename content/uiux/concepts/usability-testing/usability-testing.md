**Usability testing** is a research method used in UX to evaluate how easily users can accomplish tasks with a product, service, or interface. It provides direct insights into how real users interact with a design and where they encounter confusion, friction, or failure.

Unlike surveys or focus groups, usability testing is task-based, users are given specific goals to complete while designers or researchers observe and collect feedback.

## When and Why It’s Used

Usability testing can be conducted at various points in the design lifecycle:

- _Early stages_  
  Run with wireframes or prototypes to validate layout, flow, and interaction logic before development.

- _Post-launch_  
  Identify usability issues in a live product and gather insights for future iterations or updates.

- _Before handoff_  
  Confirm that critical flows like onboarding, checkout, or settings are intuitive and error-free.

- _Comparative testing_  
  Compare two design versions (A/B testing) to determine which performs better based on completion rates or user satisfaction.

## Key Elements of a Usability Test

- **Defined tasks**  
  Users are asked to complete tasks like “Find the return policy” or “Add an item to the cart.” These should be realistic and clear.

- **Representative users**  
  Participants should reflect the actual user base in terms of goals, experience, and accessibility needs.

- **Observation and note-taking**  
  Sessions are observed either in person or remotely. Researchers record behaviors, hesitation, and verbal feedback.

- **Think-aloud protocol**  
  Users are often encouraged to speak their thoughts while performing tasks to reveal mental models and confusion points.

- **Success metrics**  
  Outcomes like task completion rate, error count, and time on task are tracked alongside qualitative observations.

> _Note: Usability testing focuses on the user's interaction with the interface — it is not a test of the user, but of the design._

## Types of Usability Testing

- **Moderated testing**  
  A researcher is present (physically or virtually) to guide the session, ask follow-ups, and clarify tasks.

- **Unmoderated testing**  
  Users complete tasks independently, often through a recorded browser or app session.

- **Remote testing**  
  Sessions are conducted via screen share or testing platforms, allowing access to diverse participants.

- **In-person testing**  
  Often conducted in a lab or controlled space for direct observation and richer context.
