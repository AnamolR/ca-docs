**Teslers Law**, also called the _Law of Conservation of Complexity_, is a principle of interaction design that says:

> Every application has an inherent amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal with it — the user, the system, or the designer. — Larry Tesler, Apple Human Factors Engineer

In other words, you cannot eliminate complexity entirely — but you can choose whether the _user_, the _design_, or the _technology_ handles it. Teslers Law reminds UX designers to _shield users from unnecessary complexity_ by taking on that burden through thoughtful design.

## What It Means in UX

In practice, Teslers Law is about _minimizing the cognitive load_ on users. If an interaction is too complex, users get overwhelmed or frustrated. If designers and developers can anticipate those challenges and simplify the experience through better workflows, defaults, or automation, user satisfaction increases.

## Why It Matters

Every product, form, or flow contains decisions, logic, or steps that require effort. The trick is to _move that effort away from the user whenever possible_.

### Benefits of applying Teslers Law

- _Simplifies task completion_
  Users are more likely to finish tasks if they do not have to think too hard or manage too many options.

- _Reduces cognitive overload_
  Clear interfaces with minimal decision points help users focus on what matters.

- _Improves accessibility and inclusivity_
  Simplified paths are more usable by a broader range of users with diverse needs and abilities.

- _Enhances trust and usability_
  Products that just work create positive emotional responses and deeper engagement.

## When and Where It Applies

Teslers Law applies to nearly every interaction where complexity can be shifted from the user to the system. Common areas include:

- _Forms and input flows_
  Break large forms into manageable steps. Use smart defaults and pre-filled data to reduce effort.

- _Search and filtering_
  Auto-suggest, predictive text, or filters that adapt to context reduce the burden of choosing from large data sets.

- _Settings and preferences_
  Hide advanced controls unless needed. Most users prefer sensible defaults over dozens of confusing options.

- _Error handling_
  Instead of rejecting bad input, anticipate common mistakes and guide users gently to the correct format.

## How to Design with Teslers Law in Mind

- _Automate when possible_
  Autofill addresses, calculate totals, infer context, anything that spares the user from doing it manually.

- _Reduce decision-making points_
  Offer fewer, more meaningful options. Avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary choices.

- _Progressively disclose complexity_
  Keep interfaces simple up front. Reveal advanced features or controls only when needed.

- _Use defaults intelligently_
  Pre-select the most likely option based on context, past behavior, or best practices.

- _Write clear, focused microcopy_
  Good UX writing reduces confusion and speeds up task flow, especially when actions have consequences.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Some complexity must be shown when users need control or transparency.
- Hiding too much detail can make advanced use cases harder.
- Simplifying for one user group may make things harder for another — always validate with real users.

Teslers Law is about choosing _who absorbs the complexity_ — and as UX professionals, we should take on as much of that responsibility as possible to create seamless, humane digital experiences.
